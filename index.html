    <p>
        I was born in France and raised in South Texas where I currently reside with my husband and 4 week old son. 
        I love animals, which I believe is why I have 7 horses, 5 dogs, 1 cat, and 5 chickens! 
        After growing up with computer geeks as parents and surrounded by code talk, I am really looking forward to learning
        as much as possible in this class so I can get started with a real career and do some code talk of my own.
